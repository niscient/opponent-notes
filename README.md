# Opponent Notes
An Android program that tabulates data on sports opponents.

For each opponent, in each sport, you can make notes on that opponent's strengths, weaknesses, playing style, etc. You can keep track of your head-to-head (win and loss) record against that opponent, and make notes on each of your encounters.
